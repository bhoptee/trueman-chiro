As a regulated health care profession Chiropractors are able to continue practicing during the national lockdown, with adherence to guidelines. Therefore Vantage Chiropractic is open for business as usual, with the exception of the entry arrangements, as the gym at the Invictus FItness Centre will be closed during tier 4.

**Entry Arrangements:** your Chiropractor will meet you at the Invictus Fitness Centre front entrance at your scheduled appointment time, to allow you entry into the premises. After your appointment you will be accompanied to the front entrance. In the exceptional circumstance that your Chiropractor is delayed in allowing you access you will receive a text message notifying you of the expected time delay, which would typically be no greater than 5-10 minutes. In most cases your Chiropractor would be able to allow access to the premises for the use of the waiting area at the time of your appointment.

Please arrive on time for your appointment.
