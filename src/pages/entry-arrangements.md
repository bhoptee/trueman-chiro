As a regulated health care profession Chiropractors are able to continue practicing during the national lockdown, with adherence to guidelines. Therefore Vantage Chiropractic is open for business as usual, with the exception of the entry arrangements, as the gym at the Invictus Fitness Centre will be closed during the national lockdown.


**Entry Arrangements:** 

Your Chiropractor will meet you at the Invictus Fitness Centre front entrance at your scheduled appointment time to allow you entry into the premises. After your appointment you will be accompanied to the front entrance.

Please arrive on time for your appointment. If you need to contact the clinic on arrival, the clinics number is 01844 390210.
