      At your initial consultation a history of your problem will be taken,
      followed by a physical examination. Once the cause of your problem has
      been identified the Chiropractor will discuss the findings with you,
      giving a diagnosis, and treatment will follow your diagnosis. 


      The physical examination includes orthopaedic tests, which are tests to identify the specific anatomical structures which are causing your pain; functional assessment, and where indicated a neurological screen. Functional assessments are used to determine how effectively an area is working, and to help to determine what treatment or rehabilitation exercises would be most appropriate for you.
