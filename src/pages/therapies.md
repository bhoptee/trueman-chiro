          and pain. It is highly effective in reducing muscular knots (trigger

        title: Instrument Assist Soft Tissue Mobilitsation (IASTM)
        content: Used to treat restrictions in muscles and fascia. Fascia is a
          connective tissue that surrounds each muscle, linking groups of
          muscles allowing the transfer of force between body parts to generate
          movement and power. Restrictions in fascia can impact mobility,
          flexability, muscular function and result in pain.

        title: Dynamic Neuromuscular Stabilition
        image: /images/7.-dns.png
        content: Dynamic Neuromuscular Stabilition is based on a field of study called
          developmental kinesiology, which studies how we as humans develop the
          ability to move, crawl, stand, walk and run; from a baby to an adult.
          Through this area of study it has been possible to determine the
          foundations for creating stability, movement and power in the human
          body. This knowledge can be applied to assist the individual in pain
          recover more quickly, identify and correct patterns of movement which
          lead to pain and injury, and optimise performance in sports and
          exercise.

        content: >-
          With the advantage of being located in a facility with a
          well-appointed gym on site, we're able to offer one to one gym-based
          assessment and rehabilitation. Being able to assess how you're
          performing your exercise routine means we can identify key areas to
          improve and optimise, and/or determine if an aspect of your routine
          would put you at risk for injury. 


          We can assess which exercises to modify or exclude if your in an injury phase, and if you would benefit from additional gym-based exercises to accelerate recovery or reduce the chance of injury recurrence. 


          25 Minute Session- is for looking at specific exercises in your routine and/or adding in a specific gym based rehabilitation exercise(s). 


          50 Minute Session- is to allow time for reviewing a larger portion of your exercise routine and for covering gym based rehabilitation or performance exercises as needed.
