          With the advantage of being located in a facility with a
          well-appointed gym on site, we're able to offer one to one gym-based
          assessment and rehabilitation. Being able to assess how you're
          performing your exercise routine means we can identify key areas to
          improve and optimise, and/or determine if an aspect of your routine
          would put you at risk for injury. 


          We can assess which exercises to modify or exclude if your in an injury phase, and if you would benefit from additional gym-based exercises to accelerate recovery or reduce the chance of injury recurrence. 


          25 Minute Session- is for looking at specific exercises in your routine and/or adding in a specific gym based rehabilitation exercise(s). 


          50 Minute Session- is to allow time for reviewing a larger portion of your exercise routine and for covering gym based rehabilitation or performance exercises as needed.
