          With the advantage of being based in a facility with a well-appointed
          gym on site, we're able to offer one to one gym-based assessment and
          rehabilitation. Being able to assess how you're performing your
          exercise routine means we can identify key areas to improve and
          optimise. What exercises to modify or exclude if your in an injury
          phase, and if you would benefit from additional gym-based exercises to
          accelerate recovery or reduce the chance of injury recurrence.


          25 Minute Session- is for looking at specific exercises in your routine or adding in a specific set of gym based rehabilitation exercises. 


          50 Minute Session- is to allow time for reviewing a larger portion of your exercise routine and for covering additional gym based rehabilitation exercise as needed.
