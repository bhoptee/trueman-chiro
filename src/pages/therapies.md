        title: Chiropractic Manipulation
        content: Chiropratic manipulation is effective for treating joint restriction
          and dysfunction. Used to improve spinal mechanical function, reduce
          pain, and as a therapy for patients with sciatica and radiculopathy
          (pain, numbness or tingling in the back, arms or legs caused by
          irritation of nerves at the spine).

        content: Is the use of acupuncture needles to treat muscles, connective tissue
          and pain. It is highly effective in reducing muscular knots (trigger
          points), taut bands, and scar tissue. Acupuncture has applications
          related to pain management and chronic pain.

        title: Instrument Assisted Soft Tissue Mobilisation (IASTM)
        content: Used to treat restrictions in muscles and fascia. Fascia is a
          connective tissue which surrounds each muscle, linking groups of
          muscles allowing the transfer of force between body parts to generate
          movement and power. Restrictions in fascia can impact mobility,
          flexibility, muscular function and result in pain.

        title: Activator & Impulse Adjusting Instrument
        image: /images/activator.jpeg
        content: The Activator and the Impulse Adjusting Instrument are mechanical and
          electro-mechanical treatment tools used to provide impulses / taps to
          muscles and joint capsules. Used to reduce muscular tension
          (hypertonicity) and improve joint function.

        actions: []
        content: Kinesio Taping is a type of taping used to assist muscular function,
          reduce pain and improve physiological recovery. It can be applied in a
          variety of ways, depending on whether the aim is to facilitate / help
          a muscle function or reduce pain, amongst other applications.

        title: Dynamic Neuromuscular Stabilition
        image: /images/7.-dns.png
        content: Dynamic Neuromuscular Stabilition is based on a field of study called
          developmental kinesiology, which studies how we as humans develop the
          ability to move, crawl, stand, walk and run; from a baby to an adult.
          Through this area of study it has been possible to determine the
          foundations for creating stability, movement and power in the human
          body. This knowledge can be applied to assist the individual in pain
          recover more quickly, identify and correct patterns of movement which
          lead to pain and injury, and optimise performance in sports and
          exercise.

        title: Gym Based Assessment
        image: /images/invictus-gym-interior.jpg
        content: >-
          With the advantage of being located in a facility with a
          well-appointed gym on site, we're able to offer one to one gym-based
          assessment and rehabilitation. Being able to assess how you are
          performing your exercise routine means we can identify key areas to
          improve and optimise, and/or determine if an aspect of your routine
          would put you at risk for injury. 


          We can assess which exercises to modify or exclude if your in an injury phase, and if you would benefit from additional gym-based exercises to accelerate recovery or reduce the chance of injury recurrence. 


          25 Minute Session- is for looking at specific exercises in your routine and/or adding in a specific gym based rehabilitation exercise(s). 


          50 Minute Session- is to allow time for reviewing a larger portion of your exercise routine and for covering gym based rehabilitation or performance exercises as needed.
