The treatment couch is cleaned between each patient with Clinell sanitising wipes, which are effective against Coronavirus in 30 seconds (1). Surfaces which come into human contact or are at risk of human contact are cleaned with disinfectant effective against COVID-19. 

A hand washing basin is present in the consultation room. 

Should you be at risk from being in contact someone with Coronavirus, i.e. a patient in the diary slot before or after your appointment has tested positive for COVID-19 or has shown symptoms and has informed the clinic, you will be notified.
